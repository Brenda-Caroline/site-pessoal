                    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been 
                    the industry's <a href="https://www.linkedin.com" target="_blank"> standard 
                    dummy</a> text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it 
                    to make a type <a href="mailto:brenda@gmail.com">specimen book</a>. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into 
                    electronic typesetting, remaining essentially <a href="tel:38310102">telefone</a>
                    unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing 
                    Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus 
                    PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
